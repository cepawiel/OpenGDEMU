 * \par Empty user application template
 *
 * This is a bare minimum user application template.
 *
 * For documentation of the board, go \ref group_common_boards "here" for a link
 * to the board-specific documentation.
 *
 * \par Content
 *
 * -# Include the ASF header files (through asf.h)
 * -# Minimal main function that starts with a call to system_init()
 * -# Basic usage of on-board LED and button
 * -# "Insert application code here" comment
 *
 */

/*
 * Include header files for all drivers that have been imported from
 * Atmel Software Framework (ASF).
 */

 */

/*
  Since we do not properly generate system init code, we define DONT_USE_CMSIS_INIT
  before including the device headers. We also comment out the call to SystemInit().
*/


#define DONT_USE_CMSIS_INIT
#include <asf.h>


int main(void)
{
    /* Initialize the SAM system */
    /* SystemInit(); */

    /* Replace with your application code */
    while (1) 
    {
    }
}
