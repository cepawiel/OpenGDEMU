/**
 * \defgroup asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_group AT25DFx SerialFlash Driver
 *
 * This driver provides an interface for basic usage of SerialFlash devices,
 * i.e., read/write, global and local protect/unprotect of sectors, and
 * sleep/wake.
 *
 * It supports multiple instances, and the instances can be connected to either
 * common or individual SPI interfaces. For a list of the supported SerialFlash
 * types, see \ref at25dfx_type.
 *
 * The following peripherals are used by this module:
 * - \ref SERCOM SPI (data transfer)
 * - \ref PORT (chip selection)
 *
 * The outline of this documentation is as follows:
 * - \ref asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_prerequisites
 * - \ref asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_module_overview
 * - \ref asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_special_considerations
 * - \ref asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_extra_info
 * - \ref asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_examples
 * - \ref asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_api_overview
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * This driver requires that the SPI drivers are instantiated, initialized and
 * enabled by the user, and that the SPI instances are persistent for as long as
 * the associated instances of this driver exist or are used. To ensure
 * persistence of the SPI instances, the convention is to define them in the
 * same scope as the instances of this driver, which is usually a global one.
 *
 * The hardware abstraction layer (HAL) of this driver supports several SPI
 * driver implementations, but not at the same time. So for a given project, one
 * must select which implementation to support, and use it for all instances.
 * The reader is assumed to be familiar with how to configure and initialize the
 * SPI drivers, but the basic configuration to use is supplied by this driver's
 * HAL:
 * - \ref at25dfx_spi_get_config_defaults() for polled SERCOM SPI
 * - \ref at25dfx_spi_master_vec_get_config_defaults() for SERCOM SPI Master
 *    with Vectored I/O
 *
 * To ensure correct operation, the user should not change anything in the base
 * configuration except the baud rate, the SERCOM MUX and the pin MUX settings.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * This driver enables the user to do basic operations on SerialFlash devices in
 * the AT25DFx series, such as checking their presence, reading from and writing
 * to them, putting them to sleep and waking them back up when needed. Basic
 * security is implemented, i.e., sector protection to prevent accidental erase
 * and write. Functionality for permanently locking and securing AT25DFx devices
 * is not implemented in this driver.
 *
 * Each instance of this driver corresponds to a single AT25DFx device, and must
 * be associated with an instance of the SPI driver supported by the selected
 * HAL implementation, as well as a PORT pin for chip select (CS).
 *
 * All functions of this driver are blocking, which means that they do not
 * return until the initiated operation completes. Further, since the selected
 * HAL might use an interrupt-driven driver, this driver should not be used
 * within interrupts.
 *
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_module_spi_share SPI Bus Sharing
 *
 * SerialFlash devices can share a SPI bus, due to the use of CS lines. SPI bus
 * sharing is supported by this driver without any special configuration. To
 * share a SPI bus, simply associate the same SPI driver instance to multiple
 * instances of this driver.
 *
 * The \ref asfdoc_sam0_at25dfx_example "figure below" illustrates an example
 * where two out of three instances of this driver are associated with the same
 * SPI driver instance.
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_sam0_at25dfx_example
 * \image html at25dfx.png "AT25DFx and SPI instance sharing."
 *
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_module_threads Use in Threaded Environments
 *
 * The functions of this driver rely on the locking mechanism in the SPI drivers
 * to ensure exclusive access to a SPI driver instance for the entire duration
 * of an operation, such as writing data to the AT25DFx device. They will not
 * wait for an already locked instance to be unlocked. Instead, they will simply
 * return a status code indicating that it was busy.
 *
 * This behavior means that the functions are thread safe in the sense that no
 * two operations may interfere with each other. It also means that there is no
 * queueing of operations. Assuming the illustration above was a multi-threaded
 * application, it would have to wait for an operation on AT25DFx instance #2 to
 * end before one could be initiated on instance #3, and vice versa. If queueing
 * of operations is needed, it must be implemented as a layer on top of this
 * driver.
 *
 * Be aware that the protocol implementation in this driver is not interrupt-
 * driven, and the HAL may use a polled driver. Hence, an on-going operation may
 * be temporarily paused if the MCU switches threads.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_special_considerations Special Considerations
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_special_dev Device Specifics
 *
 * The available erase block sizes, and the availability and granularity of
 * protection sectors may differ between devices.
 *
 * For example, with AT25F512B (\ref AT25DFX_512B), issuing a 64 kB block erase
 * command will cause a 32 kB erase, and it does not support setting protection
 * on individual sectors, only globally.
 *
 * Refer to the SerialFlash device's datasheet for details about which
 * operations are supported and what limitations apply to them.
 *
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_common2_at25dfx_special_flash Flash Memory Behavior
 *
 * The reader should be aware of some details of how flash memory generally
 * functions:
 * -# Erasing a flash memory block means that all bits in the block are reset to
 *    a high level (logical "1"), i.e., all bytes will read as \c 0xFF.
 * -# Writing to a flash memory location will only set relevant bits to a low
 *    level (logical "0"), never to a high level.
 * -# It is possible to write several times to a flash memory block without
 *    erasing, but there may be limitations on the number of times it can be
 *    done.
