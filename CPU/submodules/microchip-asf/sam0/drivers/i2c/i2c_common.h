 *
 * \section asfdoc_samb_i2c_overview Module Overview
 *
 * The outline of this section is as follows:
 * - \ref asfdoc_samb_i2c_functional_desc
 * - \ref asfdoc_samb_i2c_bus_topology

 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_functional_desc Functional Description
 * The I<SUP>2</SUP>C provides a simple two-wire bidirectional bus consisting of a
 * wired-AND type serial clock line (SCL) and a wired-AND type serial data line
 * (SDA).
 *
 * The I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus provides a simple, but efficient method of interconnecting
 * multiple master and slave devices. An arbitration mechanism is provided for
 * resolving bus ownership between masters, as only one master device may own
 * the bus at any given time. The arbitration mechanism relies on the wired-AND
 * connections to avoid bus drivers short-circuiting.
 *
 * A unique address is assigned to all slave devices connected to the bus. A
 * device can contain both master and slave logic, and can emulate multiple
 * slave devices by responding to more than one address.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_bus_topology Bus Topology
 * The I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus topology is illustrated in
 * \ref asfdoc_samb_i2c_bus_topology_figure "the figure below". The pull-up
 * resistors (Rs) will provide a high level on the bus lines when none of the
 * I<SUP>2</SUP>C devices are driving the bus. These are optional, and can be
 * replaced with a constant current source.

 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_transactions Transactions
 * The I<SUP>2</SUP>C standard defines three fundamental transaction formats:
 * - Master Write
 *   - The master transmits data packets to the slave after addressing it
 * - Master Read
 *   - The slave transmits data packets to the master after being addressed
 * - Combined Read/Write
 *   - A combined transaction consists of several write and read transactions
 *
 * A data transfer starts with the master issuing a \b Start condition on the
 * bus, followed by the address of the slave together with a bit to indicate
 * whether the master wants to read from or write to the slave.
 * The addressed slave must respond to this by sending an \b ACK back to the
 * master.
 *
 * After this, data packets are sent from the master or slave, according to the
 * read/write bit. Each packet must be acknowledged (ACK) or not
 * acknowledged (NACK) by the receiver.
 *
 * If a slave responds with a NACK, the master must assume that the slave
 * cannot receive any more data and cancel the write operation.
 *
 * The master completes a transaction by issuing a \b Stop condition.
 *
 * A master can issue multiple \b Start conditions during a transaction; this
 * is then called a \b Repeated \b Start condition.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_address_packets Address Packets
 * The slave address consists of seven bits. The 8<SUP>th</SUP> bit in the transfer
 * determines the data direction (read or write). An address packet always
 * succeeds a \b Start or \b Repeated \b Start condition. The 8<SUP>th</SUP> bit is handled
 * in the driver, and the user will only have to provide the 7-bit address.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_data_packets Data Packets
 * Data packets are nine bits long, consisting of one 8-bit data byte, and an
 * acknowledgement bit. Data packets follow either an address packet or another
 * data packet on the bus.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_trans_examples Transaction Examples
 * The gray bits in the following examples are sent from master to slave, and
 * the white bits are sent from slave to master.
 * Example of a read transaction is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_samb_i2c_trans_examples_i2c_read "the figure below". Here, the
 * master first issues a \b Start condition and gets ownership of the bus. An
 * address packet with the direction flag set to read is then sent and
 * acknowledged by the slave. Then the slave sends one data packet which is
 * acknowledged by the master. The slave sends another packet, which is not
 * acknowledged by the master and indicates that the master will terminate the
 * transaction. In the end, the transaction is terminated by the master issuing
 * a \b Stop condition.
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_samb_i2c_trans_examples_i2c_read
 * \image html i2c_read.svg "I2C Packet Read" Width=100%
 *
 * Example of a write transaction is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_samb_i2c_trans_examples_i2c_write "the figure below". Here, the
 * master first issues a \b Start condition and gets ownership of the bus. An
 * address packet with the dir flag set to write is then sent and acknowledged
 * by the slave. Then the master sends two data packets, each acknowledged by
 * the slave. In the end, the transaction is terminated by the master issuing
 * a \b Stop condition.
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_samb_i2c_trans_examples_i2c_write
 * \image html i2c_write.svg "I2C Packet Write" Width=100%
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_repeated_start Repeated Start
 * To issue a \b Repeated \b Start, the functions postfixed \c _no_stop must be
 * used.
 * These functions will not send a \b Stop condition when the transfer is done,
 * thus the next transfer will start with a \b Repeated \b Start. To end the
 * transaction, the functions without the \c _no_stop postfix must be used
 * for the last read/write.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_multi_master Multi Master
 * In a multi master environment, arbitration of the bus is important, as only
 * one master can own the bus at any point.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_arbitration Arbitration
 *
 * \par Clock stretching
 * The serial clock line is always driven by a master device. However, all
 * devices connected to the bus are allowed stretch the low period of the clock
 * to slow down the overall clock frequency or to insert wait states while
 * processing data.
 * Both master and slave can randomly stretch the clock, which will force the
 * other device into a wait-state until the clock line goes high again.
 *
 * \par Arbitration on the data line
 * If two masters start transmitting at the same time, they will both transmit
 * until one master detects that the other master is pulling the data line low.
 * When this is detected, the master not pulling the line low, will stop the
 * transmission and wait until the bus is idle.
 * As it is the master trying to contact the slave with the lowest address that
 * will get the bus ownership, this will create an arbitration scheme always
 * prioritizing the slaves with the lowest address in case of a bus collision.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_clock_sync Clock Synchronization
 * In situations where more than one master is trying to control the bus clock
 * line at the same time, a clock synchronization algorithm based on the same
 * principles used for clock stretching is necessary.
 *
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_i2c_bus_states Bus States
 * As the I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus is limited to one transaction at the time,
 * a master that wants to perform a bus transaction must wait until the bus is
 * free.
 * Because of this, it is necessary for all masters in a multi-master system to
 * know the current status of the bus to be able to avoid conflicts and to
 * ensure data integrity.
 * \li \b IDLE No activity on the bus (between a \b Stop and a new \b Start
 * condition)
 * \li \b BUSY If another master is driving the bus
