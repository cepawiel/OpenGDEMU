/**
 * \defgroup asfdoc_samb_dma_group SAM Direct Memory Access Controller Driver (DMAC)
 *
 * This driver for Atmel&reg; | SMART SAM devices provides an interface for the configuration
 * and management of the Direct Memory Access Controller(DMAC) module within
 * the device. The DMAC can transfer data between memories and peripherals, and
 * thus off-load these tasks from the CPU. The module supports peripheral to
 * peripheral, peripheral to memory, memory to peripheral, and memory to memory
 * transfers.
 *
 * The following peripherals are used by the DMAC Driver:
 * - DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller)
 *
 * The following devices can use this module:
 *  - Atmel | SMART SAM B11
 *
 * The outline of this documentation is as follows:
 * - \ref asfdoc_samb_dma_prerequisites
 * - \ref asfdoc_samb_dma_module_overview
 * - \ref asfdoc_samb_dma_special_considerations
 * - \ref asfdoc_samb_dma_extra_info

 *

 * \section asfdoc_samb_dma_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_samb_dma_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * SAM devices with DMAC enables high data transfer rates with minimum
 * CPU intervention and frees up CPU time. With access to all peripherals,
 * the DMAC can handle automatic transfer of data to/from modules.
 * It supports static and incremental addressing for both source and
 * destination.
 *
 * The DMAC when used with peripheral triggers, provides a
 * considerable advantage by reducing the power consumption and performing
 * data transfer in the background.
 * The CPU can remain in sleep during this time to reduce power consumption.

 *    </tr>
 * </table>
 * The DMA channel operation can be suspended at any time by software, 
 * or after selectable descriptor execution. The DMAC driver for SAM 
 * supports four types of transfers such as peripheral to peripheral,
 * peripheral to memory, memory to peripheral, and memory to memory.
 *
 * The basic transfer unit is a beat which is defined as a single bus access.
 * There can be multiple beats in a single block transfer and multiple block
 * transfers in a DMA transaction.
 * DMA transfer is based on descriptors, which holds transfer properties
 * such as the source and destination addresses, transfer counter, and other
 * additional transfer control information.
 * The descriptors can be static or linked. When static, a single block transfer
 * is performed. When linked, a number of transfer descriptors can be used to
 * enable multiple block transfers within a single DMA transaction.
 *
 * The implementation of the DMA driver is based on the idea that DMA channel
 * is a finite resource of entities with the same abilities. A DMA channel resource
 * is able to move a defined set of data from a source address to destination
 * address triggered by a transfer trigger. On the SAM devices there are 12
 * DMA resources available for allocation. Each of these DMA resources can trigger
 * interrupt callback routines.
 * The other main features are:
 *
 * - Selectable transfer trigger source
 *  - Software
 *  - Peripheral
 * - Tree level channel priority
 *  - Normal level
 *  - High level
 *  - Top level
 * - Optional interrupt generation on transfer complete, channel error
 * - Supports multi-buffer or circular buffer mode by linking multiple descriptors
 * - Beat size configurable as 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit
 *
 * A simplified block diagram of the DMA Resource can be seen in
 * \ref asfdoc_samb_dma_module_block_diagram "the figure below".

 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_dma_module_overview_dma_channels DMA Channels
 * The DMAC in each device consists of several DMA channels, which
 * along with the transfer descriptors defines the data transfer properties.
 * - The transfer control descriptor defines the source and destination
 * addresses, source and destination address increment settings, the
 * block transfer count
 * - Dedicated channel registers control the peripheral trigger source,
 * trigger mode settings, and channel priority level settings
 *
 * With a successful DMA resource allocation, a dedicated
 * DMA channel will be assigned. The channel will be occupied until the
 * DMA resource is freed. A DMA resource handle is used to identify the specific
 * DMA resource.
 * When there are multiple channels with active requests, the arbiter prioritizes
 * the channels requesting access to the bus.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_dma_module_overview_dma_trigger DMA Triggers
 * DMA transfer can be started only when a DMA transfer request is acknowledged/granted by the arbiter. A
 * transfer request can be triggered from software, peripheral. There
 * are dedicated source trigger selections for each DMA channel usage.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_dma_module_overview_dma_transfer_descriptor DMA Transfer Descriptor
 * The transfer descriptor resides in the SRAM and
 * defines these channel properties.
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Field name</th>
 *     <th>Field width</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Source Address</td>
 *     <td>32 bits</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Destination Address</td>
 *     <td>32 bits</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Block Transfer Counter</td>
 *     <td>32 bits</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Descriptor Next Address</td>
 *     <td>30 bits</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Block Transfer Interrupt</td>
 *     <td>1 bit</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Block Transfer Stop Control</td>
 *     <td>1 bit</td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Before starting a transfer, at least one descriptor should be configured.
 * After a successful allocation of a DMA channel, the transfer descriptor can
 * be added with a call to \ref dma_add_descriptor(). If there is a transfer
 * descriptor already allocated to the DMA resource, the descriptor will
 * be linked to the next descriptor address.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samb_dma_module_overview_dma_output DMA Interrupts
 * Both an interrupt callback and an peripheral can be triggered by the
 * DMA transfer. Three types of callbacks are supported by the DMA driver:
 * transfer complete, channel suspend, and transfer error. Each of these callback
 * types can be registered and enabled for each channel independently through
 * the DMA driver API.
