/**
 * \page appdoc_preface Preface
 *
 * The Atmel&reg; Software Framework (ASF) is a collection of free embedded software
 * for Atmel microcontroller devices. It simplifies the usage of Atmel products,
 * providing an abstraction to the hardware and high-value middleware.
 *
 * ASF is designed to be used for evaluation, prototyping, design and production
 * phases. ASF is integrated in the Atmel Studio IDE with a graphical user
 * interface or available as a standalone package for several commercial and
 * open source compilers.
 *
 * This document describes the API interfaces to the low level ASF module
 * drivers of the device.
