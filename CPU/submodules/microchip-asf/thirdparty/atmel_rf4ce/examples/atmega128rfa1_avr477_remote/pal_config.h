/**
 * This section describes the
 * Board Configuration for
 * RCB V6.3 with ATmega128RFA1.
 *
 * The board RCB V6.3 with ATmega128RFA1 provides an
 * IEEE 802.15.4 single chip solution for the 2.4 GHz band.
 *
 * For more information about this board see the
 * <a href="../../../User_Guide/AVR2025_User_Guide.pdf">AVR2025 MAC User Guide</a>.
 *
 * For more information about the complete API for all software layers
 * including PAL see the
 * <a href="../../MAC/html/index.html">AVR2025: IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC Reference Manual</a>.
 *
 * Since the ATmega128RFA1 is a single chip including both MCU and transceiver,
 * there is no external interface between Transceiver and MCU such as SPI or GPIOs.
 * <BR>
 * All transceiver registers are memory mapped.
 *
 * The default clock speed is defined by @ref F_CPU and is currently 16MHz.
 * The CPU clock source is selected in mcu_clock_init() in file pal_mcu_generic.c.
 
 * The ATmega128RFA1 provides up to 10 transceiver specific interrupts:
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver main (Transmit End) interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver transmit end interrupt
 * (referred to as the transceiver main interrupt) in the corresponding
 * file pal_irq.c.
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver Receive End interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver receive end interrupt
 * in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver CCA/ED Meassurement finished interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver CCA/ED measurement
 * finished interrupt in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 *
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver timestamp (Receive Start) interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * By the time the SFD is detected, the hardware timestamps the
 * current frame in the SCTSR register.
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver receive start interrupt
 * (referred to as the transceiver timestamp interrupt) in the corresponding
 * file pal_irq.c.
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is only enabled by setting the compile switch BEACON_SUPPORT
 * or ENABLE_TSTAMP.
 *
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver PLL lock interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver  PLL lock interrupt
 * in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is only enabled by setting the compile switch
 * ENABLE_ALL_TRX_IRQS.
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver PLL unlock interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver  PLL unlock interrupt
 * in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is only enabled by setting the compile switch
 * ENABLE_ALL_TRX_IRQS.
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver Frame Address Match interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver frame address match interrupt
 * in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is only enabled by setting the compile switch
 * ENABLE_ALL_TRX_IRQS.
 *
 * - <B>Transceiver Wakeup Finished interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver awake interrupt
 * in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is only enabled by setting the compile switch
 * ENABLE_ALL_TRX_IRQS.
 *
 * - <B>AES Encryption Ready interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver AES encryption ready interrupt
 * in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is only enabled by setting the compile switch
 * ENABLE_ALL_TRX_IRQS.
 *
 * - <B>Batterie Monitor Alert interrupt:</B>
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is used in the ISR for the transceiver battery low interruptt interrupt
 * in the corresponding file pal_irq.c.
 * <BR>
 * This interrupt is only enabled by setting the compile switch
 * ENABLE_ALL_TRX_IRQS.
 *
 * The function for reading the current timestamp (pal_trx_read_timestamp())
 * is located in the corresponding file pal_board.c.
 * <BR>
 * This function needs to be called explicitly at the instant when the current
 * timestamp shall be retrieved. For example in the AVR2025 MAC for ATmega128RFA1
 * this is done whenever a Transceiver Receive Start interrupt occurs.
 * For more implementation details see function trx_irq_timestamp_handler_cb()
 * in file TAL/ATMEGARF_TAL_1/Src/tal_irq_handler.c.
 
 * This board provides 3 LEDs that are connected to pins 2-4 of port E.
 * See @ref LED_PORT and other corresponding defines.
 
 * This board provides 1 button that is connected to pin 5 of port E.
 * See @ref BUTTON_PORT and other corresponding defines.
 
 * This board provides two UART channels - UART_0 and UART_1,
 * but usually SIO is not used with plain RCBs.
 
 * This board provides an external EEPROM,
 * i.e. the IEEE address of the plaform is already stored in the
 * external EEPROM based on AT25010.
 * <BR>
 * Once this switch is set (and thus the external EEPROM is enabled),
 * each call of function pal_ps_get() with parameter ps_type set to
 * @ref EXTERN_EEPROM (see pal.c) results in a call of
 * function extern_eeprom_get() (see pal_board.c).
 * <BR>
 * Note: In case the internal EEPROM from the MCU shall be used,
 * function  pal_ps_get() (see pal.c) nees to be called with
 * parameter ps_type set to @ref INTERN_EEPROM.
 * <BR>
 * Make sure that an appropiate IEEE address is stored in the internal EEPROM.
 
 * The following fuse settings are recommended:
 * - LF: 0xC2
 * - HF: 0x91
 * - EF: 0xFE
 *
 * Make sure that the fuse CKDIV8 is NOT set.
