/**
 * \mainpage http_netconn_example HTTP Netconn Example
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use GMAC, TC, SPI in a real-time
 * context, using the FreeRTOS kernel. The demo also features the LwIP stack on
 * top of the GMAC driver.
 *
 * \section Requirements
 *
 * This example can be used on the following boards:<br>
 * - SAM4E-EK<br>
 *
 * \section Description
 *
 * The demo relies on several FreeRTOS task to work:
 * - GFX task : draws the IP configuration menu on screen.
 *   The device IP can either be configured statically (192.168.0.100) or
 *   dynamically using DHCP.
 * - HTTP task : handles the LwIP stack to accept remote client request.
 * - HTTP-req task : instanciated by the HTTP task to answer the client
 *   request.
 *
 * Once the IP address is configured from the touch screen interface, the board
 * ressources can be accessed from any web browser providing the IP address. For
 * instance, when the IP address is configured statically :
 * <a href="http://192.168.0.100/">
 *
 * The web page gives the following information about the board status:
 * - CPU core type.
 * - Chip name.
 * - SRAM size.
 * - Flash size.
 * - Board IP.
 * - Your IP.
 * - Total number of HTTP status requests.
 * - FreeRTOS thread usage.
 * - LwIP stats.
 * - GMAC transfer rate graph.
 *
 * The web page is periodically refreshed to keep the board status up-to-date.
