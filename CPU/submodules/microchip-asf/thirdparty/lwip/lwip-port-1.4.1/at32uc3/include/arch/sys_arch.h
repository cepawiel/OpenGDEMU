the previous protection level. This function is only called during very short
critical regions. An embedded system which supports ISR-based drivers might want
to implement this function by disabling interrupts. Task-based systems might want
to implement this by using a mutex or disabling tasking. This function should
support recursive calls from the same task or interrupt. In other words,
sys_arch_protect() could be called while already protected. In that case the
return value indicates that it is already protected. */
