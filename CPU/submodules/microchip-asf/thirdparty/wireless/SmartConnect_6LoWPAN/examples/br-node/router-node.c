/**
 * \mainpage
 * \section preface Preface
 * Border Router example application uses IP64 module to communicate outside 6LoWPAN network,
 * DHCP module to get an IPv4 address and simple RPL module to create RPL DAG root.
 * This example demonstrates the ability of stack to create a DAG root and act as 
 * Border gateway to the nodes which wants to communicate outside the network.
 * This application uses IP64 module which converts IPv6 address of a node to IPv4 address 
 * and creates an entry in IP64 table and maintains it.
 * This Application uses DHCPv4 module to get an IPv4 address from outside the network.
