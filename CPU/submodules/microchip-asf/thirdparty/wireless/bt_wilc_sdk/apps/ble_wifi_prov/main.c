/** \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to provision Wi-Fi via BLE using the WILC3000
 * Wi-Fi/BLE module. <br>
 * It uses the following hardware:
 * - SAMV71 Xplained Ultra.
 * - The WILC3000 module.
 * - Thirdparty Android device.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - main.c : Initialize the SAM board and create BT and Wifi task.
 *
 * \section usage Usage
 * -# To connect the SAM board to the internet Access Point over Wi-Fi, the user must
 * -# provide credentials (SSID and passphrase) over BLE. As a first step, it is required
 * -# that the user install the Atmel BLE provision application on an Android device.
 * -# Then, power up the SAM board and run the Android application: perform a scan, select
 * -# an SSID and enter the passphrase.
 * -# Finally, press provision to connect.
 * \endcode
