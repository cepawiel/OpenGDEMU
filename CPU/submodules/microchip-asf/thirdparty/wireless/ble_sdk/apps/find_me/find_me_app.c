 * \mainpage FIND ME Example
 * \section Introduction
 * **************************** Introduction *********************************
 * + The FIND-ME Application describes the bring-up of Bluetooth® Find Me Profile and Atmel® ATBTLC1000 setup on supported platforms.
 * + The Find Me Profile **(FMP)**  is an example application, which would provide smart alert signaling about BTLC100 device. 
 *   Hence BTLC1000 device can be tracked from BLE compatible Android/iPhone by using Atmel SMART Connect application.
 *- Supported Evolution Kit -
 *	+ ATSAML21-XPRO-B + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAMD21-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAMG55-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAM4S-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *- Running the Demo -
 * + 1. Build and flash the binary into supported evaluation board.
 * + 2. Open the console using TeraTerm or any serial port monitor.
 * + 3. Press the Reset button.
 * + 4. Wait for around 10 seconds for the patches to be downloaded device will initialize and start-up.
 * + 5. The device is now in advertising mode.
 * + 6. On a BLE compatible iPhone®/Android phone, enable Bluetooth in the Settings page. Start the Atmel Smart Connect App and scan for devices. 
 *      ATMEL-FMP will be appear amongst the devices scanned. Click on ATMEL-FMP to connect to supported platform.
 * + 7. Once connected, the client side will request for the pairing procedure with the iPhone/Android phone. The console log provides a guidance for the user to 
 *       enter the pass-key on iPhone/Android phone.
 * + 8. Upon completion of connection establishment, User can see the notifications based on the alert level settings .
 * \section Modules
 * ***************************** Modules **************************************
 *- BLE Manger -  
 *  + The Event Manager is responsible for handling the following:
 *    + Generic BLE Event Handling:-
 *       + BLE Event Manager handles the events triggered by BLE stack and also responsible 
 *  	 for invoking all registered callbacks for respective events. BLE Manager 
 *  	 handles all GAP related functionality. In addition to that handles multiple connection 
 *  	 instances, Pairing, Encryption, Scanning.
 *    + Handling Multi-role/multi-connection:-
 *  	  + BLE Event Manager is responsible for handling multiple connection instances 
 *  	  and stores bonding information and Keys to retain the bonded device. 
 *  	  BLE Manager is able to identify and remove the device information when pairing/encryption 
 *		  gets failed. In case of multi-role, it handles the state/event handling of both central and peripheral in multiple contexts.
 *    + Controlling the Advertisement data:-
 *  	  + BLE Event Manager is responsible for generating the advertisement and scan response data
 *  	  for BLE profiles/services that are attached with BLE Manager.
 *
 *- BLE Profile -
 *  + The Find Me profile defines the behaviour when a button is pressed on a device to cause an immediate alert on a peer device. 
 *    This can be used to allow users to find devices that have been misplaced.
 *  + Find Me profile supports two services:
 *  + **Immediate Alert service**: 
 *    + The Immediate Alert service is instantiated as a Primary Service. There is only one instance of the Immediate Alert service on a device. 
 *      There is only one instance of the Alert Level characteristic in an Immediate Alert service. This alert continues until one of following conditions occurs: 
 *    + An implementation specific time out 
 *    + User interaction on this device 
 *    + A new alert level is written 
 *    + The physical link is disconnected
 *- BLE Platform Services -
 *  +  Interface Settings -
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAML21-XPRO-B -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAMD21-XPRO -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAMG55-XPRO -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAM4S-XPRO  -> EXT1
 *  +  Serial Console COM port settings -
 *    + Baudrate 115200
 *	  + Parity None, Stop Bit 1, Start Bit 1
 *	  + No Hardware Handshake
 *	+  6-Wire Mode Connection Setup -
 *    + Pins are 1:1 match with SAML21/D21 Xpro EXT1 Header to BTLC1000 XPro Header
 *	  + UART(No Flow Control)-SAM L21/D21 XPro Pins (Rx-Pin13, Tx-Pin14)
 *	  + UART(With Flow Control)-SAM G55 Xpro Pins (Rx-Pin13, Tx-Pin14, RTS-Pin5, CTS-Pin6, Rx-Pin16, Tx-Pin17)
 *	  + BTLC1000 Wakeup Pin-SAM G55 XPro Pins(Pin4)
 *	  + BTLC1000 Chip Enable Pin-SAM G55 XPro Pins(Pin10)
 *	  + BTLC1000 Vcc Pin-SAM L21/D21/G55 Xpro Pins(Pin20)
 *	  + BTLC1000 GND Pin-SAM L21/D21/G55 Xpro Pins(Pin19)
 *  +  4-Wire Mode Connection setup -
 * 	  + UART(With Flow Control)-SAM L21/D21 XPro Pins (Rx-Pin15, Tx-Pin17, RTS-Pin16, CTS-Pin18)
 * 	  + BTLC1000 Wakeup Pin-SAM L21/D21 XPro Pins (Rx-Pin6)
 * 	  + BTLC1000 Chip Enable Pin-SAM L21/D21 XPro Pins (Rx-Pin4)
 * 	  + UART(With Flow Control)-SAM G55/4S Xpro Pins (Rx-Pin13, Tx-Pin14, RTS-Pin5, CTS-Pin6)
 * 	  + BTLC1000 Wakeup Pin-SAM G55/4S XPro Pins(Pin4)
 * 	  + BTLC1000 Chip Enable Pin-SAM G55/4S XPro Pins(Pin10)
 * 	  + BTLC1000 Vcc Pin-SAM L21/D21/G55/4S Xpro Pins(Pin20)
 * 	  + BTLC1000 GND Pin-SAM L21/D21/G55/4S Xpro Pins(Pin19)
