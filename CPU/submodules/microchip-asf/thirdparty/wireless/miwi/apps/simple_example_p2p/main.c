/**
* \mainpage
* \section preface Preface
* The simple example application code focuses on the simplicity of the
* MiWi™ DE protocol stack application programming interfaces.
* It provides a clean and straightforward wireless communication between
* two devices with less than 30 lines of effective C code to run the stack
* in application layer for both devices. In this application,
* following features of MiWi™ DE protocol stack have been demonstrated:
* <P>• Establish connection automatically between two devices.</P>
* <P>• Broadcast a packet.</P>
* <P>• Unicast a packet.</P>
* <P>• Apply security to the transmitted packet.</P>

* Overview:            This is the main function that runs the simple
*                   example demo. The purpose of this example is to
*                   demonstrate the simple application programming
*                   interface for the MiWi(TM) Development
*                   Environment. By virtually total of less than 30
*                   lines of code, we can develop a complete
*                   application using MiApp interface. The
*                   application will first try to establish a
*                   link with another device and then process the
*                   received information as well as transmit its own
*                   information.
*                   MiWi(TM) DE also support a set of rich
*                   features. Example code FeatureExample will
*                   demonstrate how to implement the rich features
*                   through MiApp programming interfaces.
