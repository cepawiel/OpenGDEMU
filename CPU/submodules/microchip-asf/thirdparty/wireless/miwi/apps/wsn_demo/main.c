/**
* \mainpage
* \section preface Preface
* This is the reference manual for the WSN Demo Application
* The WSNDemo application implements a typical wireless sensor network scenario,
* in which one central node collects the data from a network of sensors and
* passes this data over a serial connection for further processing.
* In the case of the WSNDemo this processing is performed by the WSNMonitor PC
* application. The MiWi™ Quick Start Guide  provides a detailed description
* of the WSNDemo application scenario, and instructions on how to use WSNMonitor.
* <P>• Device types (PAN Coordinator, Coordinator and End Device) and its address in 
* MiWi™ Mesh network is displayed on the nodes.</P>
* <P>• The value of the extended address field is set equal to the value of the
* short address field.</P>
* <P>• For all frames, the LQI and RSSI fields are filled in by the coordinator
* with the values of LQI and RSSI from the received frame. This means that nodes
* that are not connected to the coordinator directly will have the same values
* as the last node on the route to the coordinator.</P>
* <P>• Sensor data values are generated randomly on all platforms.</P>
* <P>• Sending data to the nodes can be triggered when the light button on the 
* node is clicked. This also blinks the LED in node.
* </P>

* Overview:		    This is the main function that runs the simple 
*                   example demo. The purpose of this example is to
*                   demonstrate the simple application programming
*                   interface for the MiWi(TM) Development 
*                   Environment. By virtually total of less than 30 
*                   lines of code, we can develop a complete 
*                   application using MiApp interface. The 
*                   application will first try to establish a
*                   link with another device and then process the 
*                   received information as well as transmit its own 
*                   information.
*                   MiWi(TM) DE also support a set of rich 
*                   features. Example code FeatureExample will
*                   demonstrate how to implement the rich features 
*                   through MiApp programming interfaces.
