/**
 * @brief The MLME-SCAN.request primitive makes a request for a node to
 * start a scan procedure.
 *
 * 802.15.4. Section 7.1.11.1.
 *
 * The MLME-SCAN.request primitive is used to initiate a channel scan over a
 * given list of channels. A device can use a channel scan to measure the
 * energy on the channel, search for the coordinator with which it associated,
 * or search for all coordinators transmitting beacon frames within the
 * POS of the scanning device.
 *
 * The MLME-SCAN.request primitive is generated by the next higher layer and
 * issued to its MLME to initiate a channel scan to search for activity within
 * the POS of the device. This primitive can be used to perform an ED scan to
 * determine channel usage, an active or passive scan to locate beacon frames
 * containing any PAN identifier, or an orphan scan to locate a PAN to which
 * the device is currently associated.
 *
 * ED or active scans can be performed before an FFD starts operation as a
 * PAN coordinator. Active or passive scans can be performed prior to selecting
 * a PAN for association. Orphan scans can be performed to attempt to locate a
 * specific coordinator with which communication has been lost.
 *
 * All devices shall be capable of performing passive scans and orphan scans;
 * ED scans and active scans are optional for an RFD.
 *
 * When the MLME receives the MLME-SCAN.request primitive, it initiates a scan
 * in all channels specified in the ScanChannels parameter. The MLME suspends
 * all beacon transmissions for the duration of the scan. During a scan, the
 * MAC sublayer only accepts frames received over the PHY data service that are
 * relevant to the scan being performed (see 7.5.2.1).
 *
 * An ED scan allows a device to obtain a measure of the peak energy in each
 * requested channel. The ED scan is performed on each channel by the MLMEs
 * repeatedly issuing the PLME-ED.request primitive to the PHY until
 * [aBaseSuperframeDuration * (2n + 1)] symbols, where n is the value of the
 * ScanDuration parameter, have elapsed. The MLME notes the maximum energy
 * measurement and moves on to the next channel in the channel list. A device
 * will be able to store between one and an implementation-specified maximum
 * number of channel ED measurements. The ED scan terminates when the number
 * of channel ED measurements stored equals this implementation-specified
 * maximum or when every channel specified in the channel list has been scanned.
 *
 * An active scan is used by an FFD to locate all coordinators transmitting
 * beacon frames within its POS. The active scan is performed on each channel
 * by the MLMEs first sending a beacon request command (see 7.3.2.4). The MLME
 * then enables the receiver and records the information contained in each
 * received beacon in a PAN descriptor structure (see Table 41 in 7.1.5.1.1).
 * A device will be able to store between one and an implementation-specified
 * maximum number of PAN descriptors. The active scan on a particular channel
 * terminates when the number of PAN descriptors stored equals this
 * implementation-specified maximum or when [aBaseSuperframeDuration*(2n + 1)]
 * symbols, where n is the value of the ScanDuration parameter, have elapsed.
 * If the latter condition has been satisfied, the channel is considered to
 * have been scanned. Where possible, the scan is repeated on each channel and
 * terminates when the number of PAN descriptors stored equals the
 * implementation-specified maximum or when every channel in the set of
 *  available channels has been scanned.
 *
 * A passive scan, like an active scan, is used to locate all coordinators
 * transmitting beacon frames within the POS of the scanning device; the
 * difference is that the passive scan is a receive-only operation and does not
 * transmit the beacon request command. The passive scan is performed on each
 * channel by the MLMEs enabling its receiver and recording the information
 * contained in each received beacon in a PAN descriptor structure
 * (see Table 41 in 7.1.5.1.1). A device will be able to store between one and
 * an implementation-specified maximum number of PAN descriptors. The passive
 * scan on a particular channel terminates when the number of PAN descriptors
 * stored equals this implementation-specified maximum or when
 * [aBaseSuperframeDuration * (2n + 1)] symbols, where n is the value of the
 * ScanDuration parameter, have elapsed. If the latter condition has been
 * satisfied, the channel is considered to have been scanned. Where possible,
 * the scan is repeated on each channel and terminates when the number of PAN
 * descriptors stored equals the implementation-specified maximum or when
 * every channel in the set of available channels has been scanned.
 *
 * An orphan scan is used to locate the coordinator with which the scanning
 * device had previously associated. The orphan scan is performed on each
 * channel by the MLME first sending an orphan notification command
 * (see 7.3.2.3). The MLME then enables its receiver for at most
 * aResponseWaitTime symbols. If the device receives a coordinator realignment
 * command within this time, the MLME will disable its receiver. Otherwise, the
 * scan is repeated on the next channel in the channel list. The scan
 * terminates when the device receives a coordinator realignment command
 * (see 7.3.2.5) or when every channel in the set of available channels has
 * been scanned.
 *
 * The results of an ED scan are recorded in a list of ED values and reported
 * to the next higher layer through the MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive with a
 * status of MAC_SUCCESS. The results of an active or passive scan are recorded
 * in a set of PAN descriptor values and reported to the next higher layer
 * through the MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive. If no beacons were found, the
 * MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive will contain a null set of PAN descriptor
 * values and a status of NO_BEACON. Otherwise, the MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive
 * will contain the set of PANDescriptor values found, a list of unscanned
 * channels, and a status of MAC_SUCCESS.
 *
 * The results of an orphan scan are reported to the next higher layer through
 * the MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive. If successful, the MLME-SCAN.confirm
 * primitive will contain a status of MAC_SUCCESS. If the device did not receive
 * a
 * coordinator realignment command, MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive will contain
 * a status of NO_BEACON. In either case, the PANDescriptorList and
 * EnergyDetectList parameters of the MLMESCAN.confirm primitive are null.
 *
 * If any parameter in the MLME-SCAN.request primitive is not supported or is
 * out of range, the MAC sublayer will issue the MLME-SCAN.confirm primitive
 * with a status of MAC_INVALID_PARAMETER.
