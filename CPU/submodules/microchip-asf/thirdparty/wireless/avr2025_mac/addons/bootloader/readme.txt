 This bootloader is to upgrade the firmware in NCP using bootloader through a host controller.
                 _________________
                |  Bootloader PC  |  COM(USB)                EXT(USART) 
     			|	  tool        | ---------> Host Board ------------> NCP board
		        |_________________|

Supported NCP boards: 
    atxmega256a3u_zigbit_ext
    atmega256rfr2_zigbit_ext
	
Other Supported Boards:	
	atmega256a3_reb_cbb
	atmegarfa1_stb
	atmegarfr2_stb

Steps to use this bootloader:
1. Flash the corresponding bootloader .hex file. Example: For atxmega256a3u device, flash atxmega256a3u_zigbit_ext.hex 
   from the location "\thirdparty\wireless\avr2025_mac\addons\bootloader\xmega" 
2. In the host controller board,for example sam4l_xplained_pro. Flash the serial bridge application from the location 
   "\thirdparty\wireless\addons\serial_bridge\example\sam4lc4c_sam4l_xplained_pro"
3. Connect the NCP board, for example atxmega256a3u_zigbit_ext to "ext1" given in sam4l_xplained_pro (host).
   Install Bootloader_PC_Tool_Setup_1.2.2.235.exe from th location "\thirdparty\wireless\avr2025_mac\addons\bootloader"
4. Open the installed Bootloader PC tool, select the corresponding com port of the host board. 
5. Keep the serial port settings as
    Bit rate       9600(atxmega256a3u_zigbit_ext,atmega256rfr2_zigbit_ext) ,38400 (atmega256a3_reb_cbb)
	Data bits      8
	Stop bits      1
	Parity         None
	HW control     None
6. Browse and select the .srec file of application which has to be flashed in NCP.
7. Before the user clicks upload, reset button in NCP board should be pressed. When the user clicks upload, 
   he will be prompted as "please restart the device".Reset button can be released at this time and the upload will start.
8. Wait till the upload gets completed.  
9. After this completion, flash the desired application in the host board. For example, choose "thirdparty\wireless\avr2025_mac\apps\mac\beacon\coord\host" for operating it as beacon coordinator host.
10.For other boards(atmega256a3_reb_cbb,atmegarfa1_stb,atmegarfr2_stb) follow steps 1,4 - 9 .
