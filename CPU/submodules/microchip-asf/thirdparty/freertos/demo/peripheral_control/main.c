 * \mainpage FreeRTOS peripheral control functions and FreeRTOS+CLI Example
 * \section intro Introduction
 * ************* Introduction **************************************************
 *
 * The examples defined in this project demonstrate:
 *
 *	+ The blocking FreeRTOS UART API being used with FreeRTOS+CLI to create a
 *	  command console.
 *
 *	+ The fully asynchronous FreeRTOS USART API being used to send a string to
 *	  an RS232 echo server, and receive the reply.  A loopback connector can be
 *    used in place of an echo server.
 *
 *	+ The blocking FreeRTOS USART API being used with FreeRTOS+CLI to create a
 *	  command console.
 *
 *	+ The standard ASF USB CDC driver being used with FreeRTOS+CLI to create a
 *    command console.
 *
 *  + The FreeRTOS TWI API being used to write to, and read from, an I2C EEPROM.
 *    The example can be configured to use either the fully asynchronous
 *    FreeRTOS API, or the blocking FreeRTOS API.
 *
 *  + The FreeRTOS SPI API being used to write to, and read from, an SPI flash.
 *    The example can be configured to use either the fully asynchronous
 *    FreeRTOS API, or the blocking FreeRTOS API.
 *
 * A FreeRTOS software timer is used to give visual feedback of the system
 * status.  The software timer toggles LED mainSOFTWARE_TIMER_LED every 200ms to
 * show the system is running, and turns LED mainERROR_LED on if any errors have
 * been latched.
 *
 * This file also provides default implementations of the FreeRTOS idle, tick
 * malloc failed, and stack overflow hook functions.  See
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00016.html.
 *
 * Readers are recommended to also read the application note that accompanies
 * the FreeRTOS ASF API.
 *
 * \section loopback USART Echo/Loopback Example
 * ************* USART Echo/Loopback Example ***********************************
 *
 * - Functionality -
 *
 * Two tasks are created;  A transmit (or Tx) task, and a receive (or Rx) task.
 * The transmit task periodically sends one of a set of strings to the USART
 * peripheral.  The receive task expects to receive each transmitted string.
 * The receive task latches an error is the characters it receives do not
 * exactly match the characters it expects to receive.
 *
 *
 * - Software Configuration -
 *
 * The USART loopback example is created if the confINCLUDE_USART_ECHO_TASKS
 * constant is defined.  confINCLUDE_USART_ECHO_TASKS can be defined in
 * conf_example.h.
 *
 * The USART loopback example and the USART CLI example cannot be used at the
 * same time as both examples access the same USART port.
 *
 *
 * - Hardware Setup -
 *
 * The example needs every character that is transmitted on the USART port
 * to be received on the same USART port.  This can be achieved using an RS232
 * echo server (see http://www.serialporttool.com/CommEcho.htm for an example),
 * or by simply linking pin 2 on the RS232 port to pin 3 on the same RS232 port.
 *
 * By default, the RS232 communication is configured to use 115200 baud, 8 data
 * bits, no parity, one stop bit, and no flow control.
 *
 * \section usart_cli USART Command Console using FreeRTOS+CLI
 * ************* USART Command Console using FreeRTOS+CLI **********************
 *
 * - Functionality -
 *
 * A task is created that receives command line input on a USART, then sends the
 * results of executing the command to the same USART peripheral.
 *
 * A number of example command implementations are provided.  These include:
 *
 *	+ "echo-parameters".  This command accepts a variable number of parameters.
 *    Each parameter entered is echoed back individually.
 *
 *	+ "echo-three-parameters".  This command is similar to "echo-parameters",
 *    but will only accept exactly three parameters.
 *
 *  + "task-stats".  This command displays a table that includes a line for each
 *    executing task.  The table displays information including the task state,
 *    and the task's stack high water mark.  (the closer the stack high water
 *    mark value is to zero the closer the task has come to overflowing its
 *    stack).
 *
 *	+ "run-time-stats".  This command also displays a table that also includes
 *    a line for each executing task.  This time the table displays the amount
 *    of time each task has spent in the "Running" state (actually executing).
 *    Both absolute and percentage times are shown.  See
 *    http://www.freertos.org/rtos-run-time-stats.html
 *
 *	+ "create-task".  This command takes a single numerical parameter.  It
 *     creates a new task and passes the command line parameter into the task as
 *     the task parameter.  The task that is created displays the parameter value
 *     on the command console.  The "task-stats" command can be used both before
 *     and after executing the "create-task" command to see the newly created
 *	   task appear in the table of running tasks.
 *
 *	+ "delete-task".  This command deletes the task that was created by the
 *    "create-task" command.
 *
 *
 * - Software Configuration -
 *
 * The USART command console example is created if the confINCLUDE_USART_CLI
 * constant is define.  confINCLUDE_USART_CLI can be defined in conf_example.h.
 *
 * The USART loopback example and the USART CLI example cannot be used at the
 * same time as both examples access the same USART port.
 *
 *
 * - Hardware Setup -
 *
 * The RS232 USART port needs to be connected to a dumb terminal, such as
 * TeraTerm.  For the cleanest output, the terminal should be set not to echo
 * characters, transmit line feeds (LF), and receive carriage returns (CR).
 *
 * By default, the RS232 communication is configured to use 115200 baud, 8 data
 * bits, no parity, one stop bit, and no flow control.
 *
 * \section uart_cli UART Command Console using FreeRTOS+CLI
 * ************* UART Command Console using FreeRTOS+CLI **********************
 *
 * - Functionality -
 *
 * The functionality is exactly as that described for the USART command console
 * above.  Only the communication interface is different.  The UART peripheral
 * is used as a com port.
 *
 * - Software Configuration -
 *
 * The UART command console example is created if the confINCLUDE_UART_CLI
 * constant is define.  confINCLUDE_UART_CLI can be defined in conf_example.h.
 *

 * bits, no parity, one stop bit, and no flow control.
 *
 * \section usb_cdc_cli USB/CDC Command Console using FreeRTOS+CLI
 * ************* USB/CDC Command Console using FreeRTOS+CLI ********************
 *
 * - Functionality -
 *
 * The functionality is exactly as that described for the USART command console
 * above.  Only the communication interface is different.  The standard ASF USB
 * CDC driver is used as a virtual com port.
 *
 * - Software Configuration -
 *
 * The USB/CDC command console example is created if the confINCLUDE_CDC_CLI
 * constant is defined.  confINCLUDE_CDC_CLI can be defined in conf_example.h.
 *
 * You may be asked to install a USB driver the first time the host computer is
 * plugged into the target.  The file atmel_devices_cdc.inf is provided with
 * this demo for this purpose.  Select the provided atmel_devices_cdc.inf file
 * if the install new hardware wizard executes on the host computer when the USB
 * cable is inserted.
 *
 * - Hardware Setup -
 *
 * The virtual com port was tested with the following settings:  115200 baud, 8
 * data bits, no parity, one stop bit, and no flow control.  The settings might
 * not be critical.
 *
 * \section twi_eeprom_rw TWI EEPROM Read and Write
 * ************* TWI EEPROM Read and Write ***********************************
 *
 * - Functionality -
 *
 * A task is created that writes a bit pattern to an I2C EEPROM, then reads back
 * from the EEPROM to ensure the data read back matches the data previously
 * written.  An error is latched if the data read back does not match the data
 * that was written.
 *
 * The example can be configured to use either the blocking or the fully
 * asynchronous FreeRTOS functions.
 *
 * - Software Configuration -
 *
 * The TWI EEPROM example is created if the confINCLUDE_TWI_EEPROM_TASK
 * constant is define.  confINCLUDE_TWI_EEPROM_TASK can be defined in
 * conf_example.h.
 *
 * Set mainDEMONSTRATE_ASYNCHRONOUS_API to 1 to use the fully asynchronous
 * FreeRTOS API, or 0 to use the blocking FreeRTOS API.  Other tasks will
 * execute while the task is blocked.  mainDEMONSTRATE_ASYNCHRONOUS_API is
 * defined in this file.
 *
 *
 * - Hardware Setup -
 *
 * The example requires that a TWI/I2C EEPROM be present on the evaluation kit.
 * As the example uses the EEPROM built onto the evaluation kit, no hardware
 * configuration is required.
 *
 * \section spi_flash_rw SPI flash Read and Write
 * ************* SPI flash Read and Write ***********************************
 *
 * - Functionality -
 *
 * A task is created that writes a bit pattern to an SPI flash, then reads back
 * from the flash to ensure the data read back matches the data previously
 * written.  An error is latched if the data read back does not match the data
 * that was written.
 *
 * The example can be configured to use either the blocking or the fully
 * asynchronous FreeRTOS functions.
 *
 * - Software Configuration -
 *
 * The SPI flash example is created if the confINCLUDE_SPI_FLASH_TASK
 * constant is define.  confINCLUDE_SPI_FLASH_TASK can be defined in
 * conf_example.h.
 *
 * Set mainDEMONSTRATE_ASYNCHRONOUS_API to 1 to use the fully asynchronous
 * FreeRTOS API, or 0 to use the blocking FreeRTOS API.  Other tasks will
 * execute while the task is blocked.  mainDEMONSTRATE_ASYNCHRONOUS_API is
 * defined in this file.
 *
 *
 * - Hardware Setup -
 *
 * The example requires that an SPI flash be present on the evaluation kit.
 * As the example uses the flash built onto the evaluation kit (SAM3N-EK only),
 * no hardware configuration is required.
