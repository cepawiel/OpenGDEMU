 * The demo Co-routines demonstrate basic use of FreeRTOS, with inter-task
 * communication using queues and mutexes.
 *
 * For details on how the demo works, see \ref appdoc_intro.
 *
 * For detailed information on the Co-routines, see:
 * - \ref main_routine()
 * - \ref graph_routine()
 * - \ref terminal_routine()
 * - \ref about_routine()
 * - \ref uart_routine()
 *
 * The demo Co-routines depend on the following drivers:
 * - \ref oled1_xpro_io_group
 * - \ref edbg_cdc_rx_group
 * - \ref asfdoc_common2_gfx_mono
