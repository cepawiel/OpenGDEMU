/**
 *  \mainpage ATMEL PRIME DLMS Application Emulator for Service Node
 *
 *  \section Purpose
 *
 *  This application provides the service node with DLMS emulation capabilities.
 *
 *  \section Requirements
 *
 *  This package should be used with SAM4CP16BMB board, on which there is
 * dedicated PLC hardware.
 *
 *  \section Description
 *
 *  This application will configure the PRIME stack and its serial interface to
 * use PHY, MAC and IEC_432 layers as Service Node. It will also implement a DLMS 
 * application emulator that will interact with a base node with DLMS capabilities.
 *
 *  \section Usage
 *
 *  -# Build the program and download it into the evaluation board. Please
 *     refer to the
 *     <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/appnotes/atmel-42438-sam-ba-overview-and-customization-process_applicationnote_at09423.pdf">
 *     SAM-BA User Guide</a> or the
 *     <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/appnotes/doc6310.pdf">
 *     GNU-Based Software Development</a>
 *     application note depending on the solutions that users choose.
 *     \endcode
 *  -# The application will start PRIME standard as Service Node mode.
 *	-# The application is configured to serialize several protocols with
 * these settings:
 *    - Uart0 Serial port
 *	  - 115200 bauds
 *    - TX buffer: 1024 bytes, Rx buffer: 1024 bytes
 *    - Serialized protocols in use:
 *              - Prime Management
