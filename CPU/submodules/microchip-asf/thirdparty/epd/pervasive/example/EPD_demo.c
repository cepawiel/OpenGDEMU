 * \note
 * - Released Date: 10 Mar, 2014.  Version: 1.11
 * - PDi = Pervasive Displays Inc.(PDi) http://www.pervasivedisplays.com
 * - EPD = Electronic Paper Display (Electrophoretic Display)
 * - COG = Chip on Glass, the driver IC on EPD module
 * - COG G1 or G2: G is for generation. PDi offers V110 with G1 COG and V230 with G2 COG
 *   EPD to the market.(~2014)
 * - For driving PDi's small size EPDs, please read the "COG Driver Interface
 *   Timing" document(hereinafter COG Document) first. It explains the interface
 *   to the COG driver of EPD for a MCU based solution.

 * - This project code supports EPD size: 1.44 inch, 2 inch and 2.7 inch
 * - Supports Atmel Xplained PRO: ATMEGA256RFR2 Xplained PRO
 *
 * \section File_Explanation
 * - <b>image_data:</b>\n
 *   It defines the image arrays of each EPD size. User can use the array without
 *   application input.
 * - <b>Config</b> folder:\n
 *     -# <b>conf_EPD:</b> The EPD configurations.\n
 *        - COG_Vxxx_Gx: define which COG driving waveform you will use
 *        - COG_SPI_baudrate: SPI speed
 * - <b>Pervasive_Displays_small_EPD</b> folder:\n
 *   All of the COG driving waveforms are located in this folder. Logically developer
 *   doesn't need to change the codes in this folder in order to keep correct driving
 *   the EPDs.\n\n
 *   <b><em>Software architecture:</em></b>\n
 *   [Application] <-- [COG Interface (<em>EPD_controller</em>)] <-- [COG Process
 *   (<em>EPD_COG_process</em>)] <-- [Hardware Driver (<em>EPD_hardware_driver
 *   & EPD_hardware_gpio</em>)]\n\n
 *    -# <b>EPD_hardware_driver:</b>\n
 *       Most of the COG hardware initialization and configuration. User can implement
 *       the driver layer of EPD if some variables need to be adjusted. The provided
 *       settings and functions are Timer, SPI, PWM, temperature and EPD hardware initialization.
 *    -# <b>EPD_hardware_gpio:</b>\n
 *       GPIO pins configuration.
 *    -# <b>EPD_COG_process.h:</b>\n
 *       The common definition of COG driving process.
 *    -# <b>EPD_controller:</b>\n
 *       The interface for external function to work with EPD.
 *    -# <b>EPD_COG:</b>\n
 *       The link source of different COG and EPD switching to be used.
 *    -# <b>COG</b> folder:\n
 *       Each COG driving file presents the different waveform driving processes of COG
 *       and updating stages.
 *       The parameters of driving different EPD is defined at COG_parameters_t structure
 *       which is easy for developer adjusting initial parameters, resolution, frame time
 *       of MCU and the size of data line.
 *       - <b>EPD_COG_process_Vxxx_Gx:</b>\n
 *         The waveform driving processes and updating stages of COG v? with VXXX EPD.
 *       - <b>EPD_COG_partial_update_Vxxx:</b>\n
 *         The partial update waveform of driving processes and updating stages
 *         of COG v? with VXXX EPD.
 *
 *
 * \section Use_Case
 * -# <b>EPD_display_from_pointer</b>: Load two image data arrays from image_data.c
 *   according to predefined EPD size.
 * -# <b>EPD_display_from_flash</b>:
 *   Load stored image data from flash memory according to predefined EPD size. User
 *   must convert 1 bit bitmap image file to hex data in advance and store in flash
 *   memory.
 *
 * \section Steps
 * -# Ensure the EPD is connected correctly on the EPD Xplained Pro extension board
 * -# Connect the EPD Xplained Pro to the ATMEGA256RFR2 Xplained Pro header marked EXT3
 * -# Connect the ATMEGA256RFR2 Xplained Pro to computer's USB port via USB cable
 * -# Ensure what the EPD size you are connecting. Open Atmel Studio Project properties 
 *    under Symbols and find "USE_EPD_Type=USE_EPD200". Change the USE_EPDXXX 
 *    to the correct size.
 * -# Close the J2 jumper if the connected EPD is 1.44" V110, 1.44" V230 or 2" V230.
 *    For the other types, please keep the J2 is opened.
 * -# Start debugging to program the driving code to MCU. The EPD will show two images
 *   alternatively change every 10 seconds (default).
