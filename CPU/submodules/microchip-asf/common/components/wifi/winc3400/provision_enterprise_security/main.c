/** \mainpage
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates the use of the WINC3400 with the SAMD21 Xplained Pro
 * board to start Wi-Fi provisioning mode using simple HTTPS server implemented in SAMD21.
 * This example support provisioning in following Wi-Fi Security mode.
 * - Open
 * - WPA/WPA2 PSK
 * - WEP
 * - 802.1X Enterprise security
 * The following enterprise security methods are supported
 * - TTLSv0 with MSCHAPV2
 * - PEAPv0/1 with MSCHAPV2
 * - EAP with TLS
 * - PEAPv0/1 with TLS
 *
 * It uses the following hardware:
 * - the SAMXXX Xplained Pro.
 * - the WINC3400 on EXT1.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - main.c : Initialize the WINC3400 and connect AP using security WPA/WPA2 enterprise.
 *
 * \section usage Usage
 * -# Assemble the devices and connect to USB debug cable from PC.
 * -# On the computer, open and configure a terminal application as the follows.
 * \code
 *    Baud Rate : 115200
 *    Data : 8bit
 *    Parity bit : none
 *    Stop bit : 1bit
 *    Flow control : none
 * \endcode
 *
 * -# Prepare an AP that supports OPEN / WEP / WPA/WPA2 enterprise security.
 * -# For connecting to enterprise network, you need to know following things before configuring RADIUS server settings in the AP.
 * Ask your network administrator to get there information and configure it in the AP.
 * \code
 *    User name
 *    Password
 *    Name of wireless network
 *    Root certificate file
 *    TLS certificate and key (for TLS connection)
 * \endcode
 *
 * -# Build and run the application. The WINC3400 will enumerate as a soft AP with SSID provided by the parameter PROV_WLAN_SOFTAP_SSID.
 * Connect Laptop / Mobile to the enumerated soft AP. Once the Wi-Fi Link is established, Open Google chrome or Firefox web browser and
 * open the web page http://192.168.1.1/provisioning.html and provide the credential of the AP to which WINC3400 has to connected and
 * click connect button.
 * If the device connected successfully, IP address which is assigned by DHCP will be displayed on the terminal program.
