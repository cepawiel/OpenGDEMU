/**

 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This application uses the common sensor service to obtain pressure data
 * from a MEMS pressure sensor installed on an Atmel development board.  After
 * initializing sensor platform board resources, this demonstration will
 * attach and initialize a barometric sensor installed on the development board.
 * In the case of the Atmel Xplained development boards, for example, the
 * platform should be fitted and built for a Sensors Xplained Pressure sensor
 * board.
 *
 * Once an appropriate pressure sensor is initialized, the
 * \ref pressure_altitude() utility in the ASF Common Sensor service is used
 * to calculate the pressure altitude as a function of the current barometric
 * pressure and configured local mean sea level pressure.  Adjust the
 * \ref MSL_PRESSURE constant to local conditions to improve the altitude
 * estimate.  The pressure sample, converted to hectopascals, along with
 * altitude estimate are printed to the application console.  In the case of
 * Atmel Xplained development boards communicating over a USART, the serial
 * channel configuration is selected by the board configuration files; see, for
 * example, the conf_board.h file in the project directories.
