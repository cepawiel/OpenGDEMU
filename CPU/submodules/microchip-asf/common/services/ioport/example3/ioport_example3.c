 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the common IOPORT service for pin input
 * and output.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 *  - ioport.h common gpio definitions

 *  - conf_example.h example definitions
 *
 * \section ioport_service_section services/ioport/ioport.h
 * The common IOPORT service is described in
 * \ref ioport_group section.
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
