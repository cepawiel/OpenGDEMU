/**
 * \mainpage ASF USB Device HID Multi-touch
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB Device HID Multi-touch
 * on Atmel MCU with USB module.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * The example uses the buttons or sensors available on the board
 * to simulate a standard multi-touch.
 * After loading firmware, connect the board (EVKxx,Xplain,...) to the USB Host.
 * When connected to a USB host system this application provides a HID multi-touch
 * with two points application in the Windows 7 operating systems.
 * This example uses the native HID driver for these operating systems.
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB Device stack and HID modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/hid/mtouch/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c         implement of user's interface (buttons, leds)
