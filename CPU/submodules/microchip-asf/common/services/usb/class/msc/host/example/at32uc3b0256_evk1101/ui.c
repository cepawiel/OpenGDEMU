 * Human interface on EVK1101 :
 * - PWR led is on when power present
 * - Led 0 is on when USB OTG cable is plugged and Vbus is present
 * - Led 1 is continuously on when a device is connected
 * - Led 1 blinks when the device is enumerated and USB in idle mode
 *   - The blink is slow (1s) with low speed device
 *   - The blink is normal (0.5s) with full speed device
 *   - The blink is fast (0.25s) with high speed device
 * - Led 2 is on when a read or write access is on going
 * - Led 3 is on when a LUN test is success
 * - Led 3 blinks when a LUN test is unsuccessful
