/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs Quick Start Guide for the SAM AT30TSE75X Temperature Sensor Driver
 * In this use case we will interface the temperature sensor, set a resolution and read
 * the temperature.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs_prereq Prerequisites
 * The temperature sensor must be connected to the device.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs_init_code Initialization Code
 * Add a global variable to store the temperature:
 * \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c temp_res
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your application main function:
 * \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs_workflow Workflow
 * -# Initialize system
 *  \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c system_init
 * -# Initialize I2C interface
 *  \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c temp_init
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs_implement Implementation
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs_imp_code Code
 * Add after initialization in main.
 * \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c impl
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_at30tse75x_qs_imp_workflow Workflow
 * -# Read THIGH register from temperature sensor:
 *  \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c read_thigh
 * -# Read TLOW register from temperature sensor:
 *  \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c read_tlow
 * -# Set temperature sensor resolution to 12-bit:
 *  \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c write_conf
 * -# Continuously read the temperature:
 *  \snippet qs_at30tse75x.c read_temp
