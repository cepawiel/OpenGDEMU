 * \defgroup ethernet_phy_group Ethernet Phy
 *
 * This is the common API for Ethernet Phy on ARMs. Additional features are available
 * in the documentation of the specific modules.
 *
 * \section ethernet_phy_group_platform Platform Dependencies
 *
 * The ethernet_phy API is partially chip- or platform-specific. While all
 * platforms provide mostly the same functionality, there are some
 * variations around how different bus types and clock tree structures
 * are handled.
 *
 * The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may
 * be variations in the function signature (i.e. parameters) and
 * behaviour. These functions are typically called by platform-specific
 * parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be
 * portable:
 *   - ethernet_phy_init()
 *   - ethernet_phy_set_link()
 *   - ethernet_phy_auto_negotiate()
 *   - ethernet_phy_reset()
