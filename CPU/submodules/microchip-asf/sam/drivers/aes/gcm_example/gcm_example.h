 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_aes_example2_intro Introduction
 * This is the documentation for the data structures, functions, variables,
 * defines, enums, and typedefs for the AES driver. <BR>It also gives several
 * examples of usage of the AES-GCM mode: <BR>
 * - GCM ciphering and deciphering.
 *
